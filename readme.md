## Introduction

The aim of this project is to show an example of the endpoint LoRaWAN stack implementation.

This LoRaWAN stack implements all regions defined in "LoRaWAN Regional Parameters v1.0.2rB" document. Class A and Class C endpoint implementation
is fully compatible with "LoRaWAN specification 1.0.2".

Each LoRaWAN application example includes the LoRaWAN certification protocol implementation.

SX1272/76 radio drivers are also provided.
In case only point to point links are required a Ping-Pong application is provided as example.

*The LoRaWAN stack API documentation can be found at: http://stackforce.github.io/LoRaMac-doc/*

* LoRaWAN
    1. Removed support for previous LoRaMac/LoRaWAN specifications
    2. Added missing MAC commands and updated others when necessary
        * Corrected the Port 0 MAC commands decryption
        * Changed the way the upper layer is notified. Now it is only  notified
        when all the operations are finished.

           When a ClassA Tx cycle starts a timer is launched to check every second if everything is finished.

        * Added a new parameter to LoRaMacEventFlags structure that indicates on which Rx window the data has been received.
        * Added a new parameter to LoRaMacEventFlags structure that indicates if there is applicative data on the received payload.
        * Corrected ADR MAC command behavior
        * DutyCycle enforcement implementation (EU868 PHY only)

          **REMARK 1** *The regulatory duty cycle enforcement is enabled by default
          which means that for lower data rates the node may not transmit a new
          frame as quickly as requested.
          The formula used to compute the node idle time is*

          *Toff = TimeOnAir / DutyCycle - TxTimeOnAir*

          *Example:*
          *A device just transmitted a 0.5 s long frame on one default channel.
          This channel is in a sub-band allowing 1% duty-cycle. Therefore this
          whole sub-band (868 MHz - 868.6 MHz) will be unavailable for 49.5 s.*

          **REMARK 2** *The duty cycle enforcement can be disabled for test
          purposes by calling the LoRaMacSetDutyCycleOn function with false
          parameter.*
        * Implemented aggregated duty cycle management
        * Added a function to create new channels
        * Implemented the missing features on the JoinAccept MAC command
        * Updated LoRaMacJoinDecrypt function to handle the CFList field.
    3. Due to duty cycle management the applicative API has changed.
    All applications must be updated accordingly.
    4. Added the possibility to chose to use either public or private networks
