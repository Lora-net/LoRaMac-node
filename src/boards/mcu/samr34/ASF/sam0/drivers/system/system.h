 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The System driver provides a collection of interfaces between the user
 * application logic, and the core device functionality (such as clocks, reset
 * cause determination, etc.) that is required for all applications. It contains
 * a number of sub-modules that control one specific aspect of the device:
 *
 * - System Core (this module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_clock_group "System Clock Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_interrupt_group "System Interrupt Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_pinmux_group "System Pin Multiplexer Control" (sub-module)
 *
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SYSTEM_SUPPORT
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vreg_l21 Voltage Regulator
 * The SAM device controls the voltage regulators for the core (VDDCORE) and
 * backup (VDDBU) domains. It sets the voltage regulators according to the sleep
 * modes, the performance level, or the user configuration.
 *
 * In active mode, the voltage regulator can be chosen on the fly between a LDO
 * or a Buck converter. In standby mode, the low power voltage regulator is used
 * to supply VDDCORE.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_bbps Battery Backup Power Switch
 * The SAM device supports connection of a battery backup to the VBAT power pin.
 * It includes functionality that enables automatic power switching between main
 * power and battery backup power. This will ensure power to the backup domain,
 * when the main battery or power source is unavailable.
 * \endif
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAMC21_SYSTEM_SUPPORT
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vreg_c21 Voltage Regulator
 * The SAM device controls the voltage regulators for the core (VDDCORE). It sets
 * the voltage regulators according to the sleep modes.
 *
 * There are a selectable reference voltage and voltage dependent on the temperature
 * which can be used by analog modules like the ADC.
 * \endif
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vref Voltage References
 * The various analog modules within the SAM devices (such as AC, ADC, and
 * DAC) require a voltage reference to be configured to act as a reference point
 * for comparisons and conversions.
 *
 * The SAM devices contain multiple references, including an internal
 * temperature sensor and a fixed band-gap voltage source. When enabled, the
 * associated voltage reference can be selected within the desired peripheral
 * where applicable.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_reset_cause System Reset Cause
 * In some applications there may be a need to execute a different program
 * flow based on how the device was reset. For example, if the cause of reset
 * was the Watchdog timer (WDT), this might indicate an error in the application,
 * and a form of error handling or error logging might be needed.
 *
 * For this reason, an API is provided to retrieve the cause of the last system
 * reset, so that appropriate action can be taken.
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SYSTEM_SUPPORT
 * There are three groups of reset sources:
 *   - Power supply reset: Resets caused by an electrical issue. It covers POR and BOD reset.
 *   - User reset: Resets caused by the application. It covers external reset,
 *             system reset, and watchdog reset.
 *   - Backup reset: Resets caused by a backup mode exit condition.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_performance_level Performance Level
 * Performance level allows the user to adjust the regulator output voltage to reduce
 * power consumption. The user can on the fly select the most suitable performance
 * level, depending on the application demands.
 *
 * The SAM device can operate at two different performance levels (PL0 and PL2).
 * When operating at PL0, the voltage applied on the full logic area is reduced
 * by voltage scaling. This voltage scaling technique allows to reduce the active
 * power consumption while decreasing the maximum frequency of the device. When
 * operating at PL2, the voltage regulator supplies the highest voltage, allowing
 * the device to run at higher clock speeds.
 *
 * Performance level transition is possible only when the device is in active
 * mode. After a reset, the device starts at the lowest performance level
 * (lowest power consumption and lowest max. frequency). The application can then
 * switch to another performance level at any time without any stop in the code
 * execution. As shown in \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_performance_level_transition_figure.
 *
 * \note When scaling down the performance level, the bus frequency should first be
 *  scaled down in order to not exceed the maximum frequency allowed for the
 *  low performance level.
 *  When scaling up the performance level (e.g. from PL0 to PL2), check the performance
 *  level status before increasing the bus frequency. It can be increased only
 *  when the performance level transition is completed.
 *

 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_power_domain Power Domain Gating
 * Power domain gating allows power saving by reducing the voltage in logic
 * areas in the device to a low-power supply. The feature is available in
 * Standby sleep mode and will reduce the voltage in domains where all peripherals
 * are idle. Internal logic will maintain its content, meaning the corresponding
 * peripherals will not need to be reconfigured when normal operating voltage
 * is returned. Most power domains can be in the following three states:
 *
 * - Active state: The power domain is powered on.
 * - Retention state: The main voltage supply for the power domain is switched off,
 * while maintaining a secondary low-power supply for the sequential cells. The
 * logic context is restored when waking up.
 * - Off state: The power domain is entirely powered off. The logic context is lost.
 *
 * The SAM L21 device  contains three power domains which can be controlled using
 * power domain gating, namely PD0, PD1, and PD2. These power domains can be
 * configured to the following cases:
 * - Default with no sleepwalking peripherals: A power domain is automatically set
 * to retention state in standby sleep mode if no activity require it. The application
 * can force all power domains to remain in active state during standby sleep mode
 * in order to accelerate wakeup time.
 * - Default with sleepwalking peripherals: If one or more peripherals are enabled
 * to perform sleepwalking tasks in standby sleep mode, the corresponding power
 * domain (PDn) remains in active state as well as all inferior power domains (<PDn).
 * - Sleepwalking with dynamic power domain gating: During standby sleep mode, a
 * power domain (PDn) in active can wake up a superior power domain (>PDn) in order
 * to perform a sleepwalking task. The superior power domain is then automatically
 * set to active state. At the end of the sleepwalking task, the device can either
 * be woken up or the superior power domain can return to retention state.
 *
 * Power domains can be linked to each other, it allows a power domain (PDn) to be kept
 * in active state if the inferior power domain (PDn-1) is in active state too.
 *
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_power_domain_overview_table illustrates the
 * four cases to consider in standby mode.
